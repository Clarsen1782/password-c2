# password-c2

## Installation

I created this web application to generate secure passwords using the uppercase and lowercase alphabet, numbers, and special characters. The user gets to pick how long they want the password length by using a range of a minimum of 8 characters up to a maximum of 128 characters. 

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get the generator to work. I have used everything at my disposal and am stuck. I was able at one point to get the questons to come up but when I try to get the password to generate, I'm doing something wrong.


## Usage 

When finished this website will be easy to work with. By simply clicking the generate password button the user will be prompted to choose how many caracters the password will have; along with if they want to use 1 or all 4 character types. After this slection a secure random password will be generated.

This password can be stored whereever the user chooses for their safty.
